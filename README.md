ðŸš€ Whisper-Based Transcription API | Real-time & File-Based Speech-to-Text System ðŸŽ¤

This repository contains a FastAPI-powered transcription system built using OpenAI's Whisper model. The system provides file-based and live transcription support, optimized for performance using Faster-Whisper with GPU acceleration (CUDA). The API is designed to be lightweight, scalable, and ready for integration into applications requiring speech-to-text functionality.

Features:
âœ… Upload and Transcribe: Convert audio files to text using Whisper.
âœ… Live Speech-to-Text: Real-time transcription via microphone input.
âœ… FastAPI Backend: Efficient RESTful API for seamless integration.
âœ… CUDA Support: Optimized for GPU acceleration using Faster-Whisper.
âœ… Multi-Language Support: Works with various languages, including English, French, Spanish, and more.
âœ… Training & Fine-Tuning: Train the Whisper small model on custom datasets using Hugging Faceâ€™s Trainer API.
âœ… Frontend Integration: Can be connected with web-based or mobile applications.
âœ… Docker Support: Easily deploy using Docker for consistent performance.
âœ… CI/CD Ready: Automated testing and deployment via GitHub Actions.
